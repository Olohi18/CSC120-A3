- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
Before I started this class, I expected Java to be at least, similar to Python in structure. However, it's evidently wayyy different. I love it though and can't wait to be a pro in it.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Implementation might be different, but abstraction is usually very similar. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Going for Office hours proved really useful. Also, being able to connect with Uma and Tillie earlier during the assignment helped a bunch. I plan on starting the next assignment earlier and connectiong with more people from the beginning of the assignment, rather than just trying ot compare programs when we've all gone far in completing the assignment. I realized the latter usually reults in more confusion as your peers might have used completely different approaches, thus making debugging using their approach futile
